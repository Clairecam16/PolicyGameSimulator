    Fiscal policy refers to government spending and taxation decisions that influence the economy.

    **Key concepts:**
    - üè¶ **Austerity**: Reducing government spending and increasing taxes
    - üí∞ **Stimulus**: Increasing government spending and reducing taxes

    A Nash Equilibrium occurs when no player can benefit by changing their strategy unilaterally.

    The optimal strategy depends on the economic scenario:
    - During a **crisis**, coordinated stimulus might be better
    - During **inflation**, coordinated austerity might be preferred
    - During **recovery**, mixed strategies might emerge

    Historical examples of policy coordination:

    1. **2008 Financial Crisis**
    - Many countries implemented stimulus packages
    - Some European nations chose austerity

    2. **1970s Stagflation**
    - High inflation led to coordinated monetary tightening
    - Mixed fiscal responses between nations

    3. **Post-WW2 Recovery**
    - Marshall Plan provided coordinated stimulus
    - Successful international cooperation
